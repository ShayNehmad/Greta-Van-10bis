## What's with the name?
[Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg) is a Swedish environmental activist on climate change whose campaigning has gained international recognition.

That, along with the fact that [Greta Van Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Fleet) is an awesome band heavily influenced by Led Zeppelin which you should definitely check out if you're a rock fan - should give you an idea about why I chose this peculiar name. :)
